# Regime-Momentum Asset Allocation (RMAA)

This repository provides a Python implementation of the **Regime-Momentum Asset Allocation (RMAA)** strategy.  
RMAA is a **two-layer dynamic asset allocation framework**:  

1. **Macro regime detection** determines the stock/bond allocation.  
2. **Momentum scoring** within each asset class determines ETF weights.  

---

## 📊 Strategy Overview

### 1. Regime Detection
- **Indicators**
  - OECD CLI (Composite Leading Indicator, growth proxy)  
  - VIX (Volatility Index, risk proxy)  
- **Method**
  - Rolling 36-month distribution to classify High / Medium / Low  
  - Growth × Volatility → **9 regimes in total**  

### 2. Asset Allocation (Inter-asset)
- Optimize stock vs bond weights per regime to maximize Sharpe ratio  
- Constraint: Stock weight + Bond weight = 100%  
- Includes transaction costs and variance penalty  

### 3. Intra-Asset Momentum
- ETF momentum score = cumulative return from t-12 to t-1 (skip last month)  
- Negative scores truncated to zero (long-only allocation)  
- Normalized scores determine ETF weights  

### 4. Simulation & Reporting
- Split into **In-sample (2008–2019)** vs **Out-of-sample (2020–present)**  
- Performance metrics: CAGR, Annual Volatility, Sharpe Ratio  
- Outputs:
  - Cumulative return plots  
  - Optimal regime weights (stock/bond)  
  - Final ETF allocation  
  - DV01 (bond duration & rate sensitivity)  
- Results exported to Excel: `regime_allocation_report_YYYYMMDD.xlsx`
